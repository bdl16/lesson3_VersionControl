            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a way to keep multiple versions of project files organized. If a past file is needed, version control is a great way to easily recover this file instead of looking through many saved files with different dates and file names. Furthermore, version control allows members working together to access the same files, edit them, and commit them after theyâ€™ve completed their task. This topic interests me because it is a very useful way to keep track of different versions of files. Version control is relevant to the course because we will be using version control to keep track of our projects. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is a system that automatically stores different versions of files on a repository. These systems are very useful because they always take note of revision history, the dates of revision, the specifics of the changes, and merge changes to one file. Within Version Control Systems, there is one repository that holds all of the files which allows multiple users to work on the same files at the same time. I find this topic interesting because a Version Control System is an extremely useful way to organize files and revision history for an individual or an entire team. This topic is relevant to the course because we will need to keep our revision history while working on our projects so we will use a Version Control System to do this.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two types of repositories that are used in a Version Control System. These repositories are remote and local repositories. A remote repository is one that is located on a server which is shared between multiple members of a team. On the other hand, a local repository is one that is not on a server; instead, it is on the local machine of one user. The types of repositories are interesting to me because it is all a part of version control which is a very important part of development. This topic is relevant to this course as we will be doing web application development which will require us to use a repository to allow us to make use of version control.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is both free and open source. It has the power to handle all kinds of projects, no matter the size, efficiently and with high speed. Git keeps track of changes in all sorts of files to keep them organized. Furthermore, Git also supports multiple users making changes to files. The topic of Git is very interesting to me because I find it fascinating how this system is able to keep track of thousands of versions of files as well as support multiple users editing the same files. Git is a relevant topic in this course because we will be using Git as a version control system to keep track of our project files. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A distributed version control system is a type of version control system in which every member of the team has a copy of all of the repository data stored on a local repository on their local machine. This type of version control system is very beneficial because it is a very safe way to keep multiple versions of files safe as well as running these processes at a high speed. This topic is interesting to me because a distributed version control system seems very useful for version control across multiple different users and devices. This topic is relevant to web application development because we will be using a distributed version control system as Git is an example of this type of VCS. </p>
