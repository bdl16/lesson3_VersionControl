                <span class="text-muted">IP Address</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An IP address is a unique number given to every single device that is connected to the internet. These IP addresses are used to identify a device that is connected to the internet as each address is unique. However, in certain cases, you are unable to use an IP address to identify a specific person connected to the internet because in homes and businesses, the router has its own IP address so it is hard to pinpoint the specific person. This topic interests me because I find it intriguing that each device has its own identifiable number that is left behind when connecting to the internet. Furthermore, I think itâ€™s interesting that people can spoof an IP address so they are untraceable when connected to the internet. The topic of an IP address is relevant to the course as web application development we will learn both sides of web applications; the client and server side. As we will be learning about the technology on the client side, knowing what an IP address is and how they work will be an important part in understanding the client side of web application development.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Internet</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The internet is one of the most important technologies in our world today. It is used almost everywhere in the world and is an integral part of how societies across the globe function. The internet is simply a system of computer networks connected across the globe. When computers are connected in order to communicate, they are now a part of a network. The global connection of all of these networks is what makes up the internet. These computers on the internet are able to communicate through the use of the Internet Protocol which is the basis for all communication that occurs over the internet. This topic interests me because the internet is basically the most important technology that we have in our world today. It is the way that people within our society communicate and it is how we communicate with others in other societies. This topic is relevant to the course because web application development requires connection to the internet. The applications that we will be creating will be accessed through the internet and the internet will be used in the process of creating these applications.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Domain Name System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that organizes the domain names and translates IP addresses into these domain names. Websites on the internet can be reached using the IP address of the web server currently hosting the website. Because these IP addresses are not easily memorized by people, IP addresses are not a great way to humans to reach their sought after website. As a result, we use domain names to replace IP addresses. If a person types in the domain name of the website they are trying to reach, the DNS will find the matching IP address of that website allowing the user to reach the site. This topic interests me because it is fascinating how the internet works and organizes the millions of websites on the internet. The DNS system is a great way to make it easier for people to remember the websites they want to go to and organize websites in a way that makes sense. The Domain Name System is relevant to this course because the web applications that we create will be reachable by IP addresses but will also have a domain name based on the web server hosting the application.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">HTML</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">HTML is the language that is used to create web pages. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Websites are coded using HTML by following the rules and formatting guidelines of the language. This language uses special markers to specify formatting and text properties. For instance, to bold text in HTML the code will include <b> before the text and </b> after the text. All computer systems that are available today understand HTML so no matter what computer you are on, the web page will look the same. HTML helps to ensure that these websites are compatible across all devices, whether that is phones, tablets, or computers. Furthermore, HTML makes sure that websites are accessible for people with disabilities such as seeing problems. This topic interests me because I really enjoyed creating websites in HTML last semester. Also, I find it very interests how HTML converts the users input into the visual representation of the website. HTML is relevant to this course because the websites we will be creating will be coding using HTML. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">CSS is a stylesheet language that is used to describe how HTML elements are displayed on a web page. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to format and style HTML elements on a web page. With CSS, users can implement unique styles, colors, and texts to make the web page more distinctive and appealing. Furthermore, multiple pages of HTML can be formatted with one page of CSS by using an external stylesheet. This makes it very easy to style an entire website with a few external stylesheets in CSS. Also, without CSS, the uniqueness of web pages is very limited as the formatting and styles are restricted only using HTML. This topic interests me because I find it extremely fascinating how CSS can alter the look of web pages using simple commands. Another reason CSS is interesting is that it makes it very easy to make a web page look however the user wants it to look. CSS is relevant to this course because it is a very important part of web design so it will be integral in web application development. </p>
